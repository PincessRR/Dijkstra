Dijkstra

Dijkstra's shortest path

This project used HEAP data structure for Dijkstra algorithm. Data resources should be in the form as follows:

"vertice index       neighbor vertice index, distance   another neighbor, distance"   on and on

Vertices are stored in Node structure, as one basic component of Graph.
